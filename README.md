# HTML5 Video Background

Small demo of using an HTML5 video as a background for an element on a page. See it live on CodePen: http://codepen.io/pbreen/full/dNqoZq/



##Resources
For demo purposes I've used the following resources - they aren't required, but they're great and I want to thank them :)

  - Eric Meyer's CSS Reset http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
  - Static fallback background image from http://placehold.it
  - ISAF loading screen from Ace Combat 04, thanks Namco ;)
